1.0.8 - September 28, 2011
--------------------------

InboxLib:

- "one inbox to rule them all" 
- methods and properties related to setting the "active" inbox have been eliminated or renamed
- UAInboxAlertProtocol has been removed
- The inbox database has been renamed from "Airmail.db" to "UAInbox.db"

- UAInboxMessageList supports concurrent batch updates

Protocols:

- UAInboxMessageListObserver breaks out batch update events in explicit success/failure methods
- Cleaner separation from UAUser observer patterns
- New UAInboxPushHandlerDelegate protocol allows for a user-specified delegate to respond to 
  incoming in-app messages

UI Classes:

- iPad specific classes and xib files have been removed
- iPhone interfaces have been generalized to be adaptable to the iPad UI idiom
- New UAInboxOverlayController allows for displaying incoming Rich Push messages 
  in an overlay window superimposed over your content
- UAInboxMessageListController and UAInboxMessageViewController have been redesigned to be 
  embeddable in non-modal contexts, like navigation controller stacks and tab bar controllers
- New UAInboxNavUI embeds the inbox in a navigation controller or popover controller
- The InboxSample project allows you to select between multiple UI classes on the fly 
  as a quick overview of the different inbox interface styles
